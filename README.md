# Plagiarism Detection System

This project implements a basic plagiarism detection system using Python. It uses TF-IDF and cosine similarity to compare text documents.

## Folder Structure

- `data/`: Contains the documents to compare and a list of stopwords.
- `src/`: Contains the source code for preprocessing, similarity calculation, and the main script.

## Setup

1. Install dependencies:
    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
2. Run the main script:
    ```
    python src/main.py
    ```
