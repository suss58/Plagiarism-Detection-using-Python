Develop a machine learning-based tool that can analyze codebases uploaded by users and identify potential vulnerabilities before deployment, providing actionable insights for remediation.

 Key Components:

1. User Interface:
   - Develop a user-friendly web interface for user authentication, code upload, and result visualization.
   - Allow users to upload code files in various programming languages.

2. ML Model Development:
   - Feature Extraction: Extract features from the codebase such as syntax patterns, API usage, and coding practices.
   - Model Selection: Choose appropriate ML models for vulnerability detection, such as:
     - Supervised Learning: For classification tasks (e.g., SVM, Random Forest, Neural Networks) to categorize code as vulnerable or secure.
     - Unsupervised Learning: For anomaly detection (e.g., Isolation Forest, Autoencoders) to identify unusual patterns that might indicate vulnerabilities.
   - Training: Train the selected ML models on labeled datasets of vulnerable and secure code snippets.
   - Validation: Validate the trained models using a separate validation dataset to ensure accuracy and robustness.

3. Vulnerability Database:
   - Maintain a database of known vulnerabilities and their characteristics.
   - Augment the database with features extracted from historical vulnerability data.

4. Reporting System:
   - Generate detailed reports highlighting identified vulnerabilities, their severity, and suggested fixes.
   - Provide insights on potential vulnerabilities identified by ML models, including false positives and false negatives.

 Implementation Plan:

1. User Interface Development (2 weeks):
   - Design and develop a web interface for user interaction.
   - Implement file upload functionality with support for various programming languages.
